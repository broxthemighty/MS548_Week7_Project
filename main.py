Purpose:
This is the entry point for the Learnflow Base application.
It wires together the user interface (ui.py) with the service layer (service.py).
The structure follows best practices:
    - Keep main.py minimal (only startup logic).
    - Delegate business logic to service.py.
    - Delegate GUI rendering to ui.py.
